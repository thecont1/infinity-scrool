## Example: Korean restaurants in Chennai

Thanks to the presence of Korean industries in Chennai, there's a fairly large expat community in the city, and in their service, quite a number of Korean restaurants. Let's say you want to try out some authentic Korean food on your upcoming visit to Chennai.

- **Step 1 ‚Äî Search JustDial.com**

    Run a search on JustDial.com. Copy the url. Don't bother cleaning it.

- **Step 2 ‚Äî Grab 10 results**

  ```bash
  ‚Ü™ python infinity_scrool.py "https://www.justdial.com/Chennai/Korean-Restaurants/nct-10289122?trkId=2226764-chennai&term=korean" -n 10
  ```

  Automatic output filename: `Chennai-Korean-Restaurants.csv.gz`

  ![Screenshot: run 10 results](docs/screenshot-1.png)

- **Step 3 ‚Äî Filter the list (using DuckDB, for instance)**

  ```bash
  ‚Ü™ duckdb -c "SELECT name, address, city FROM 'Chennai-Korean-Restaurants.csv.gz' WHERE name LIKE '%Korean%' ORDER BY name"
  ```

    Why `.csv.gz` helps:
    - Tiny files, fast downloads and commits
    - Opens directly in Pandas and DuckDB

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('Chennai-Korean-Restaurants.csv.gz')
  ```

## Output files and naming

- Filenames are derived from the URL path. Example:
  - `https://www.justdial.com/Bangalore/Pg-Accommodations/...` ‚Üí `Bangalore-Pg-Accommodations.csv.gz`
- Columns: `datestamp, name, address, city`
- Appends on subsequent runs and removes duplicates by `name + address + city`.

## Safety and etiquette

- **Please scrape responsibly.** Don‚Äôt hammer pages. Increase `-n` gradually.
- Headless is on by default; use visible mode only when needed.
- Respect the platform. Credit your source when sharing results.

## Where things live

- Main script: `infinity_scrool.py`
- Data: `*.csv.gz` files in this folder. Open the `.gz` to get a `.csv` file.
- Screenshots used above are in the `docs/` folder.
